Game Features:

# Star-Wars-Memory-Card-Game is a classic memory card game with a Star Wars theme
You can choose your side ... are you with the Jedi ... or the Dark Side? Choose wisely
There are 8 pairs of Star Wars character cards to match; that's a total of 16 cards
A score board will keep track of the number of pairs you match
There is a timer to challenge players to match all pairs as fast as possible
The design is perfect for any and all of your devices
If The Force is not strong enough with you, tap out and press the reset button to start a new game


How to Play:

Select a card and reveal the character
Click on a second card to see if it's a match
If the characters match, the cards remain face up
If the characters do not match, the cards will be flipped back to the face down position
Continue playing until all pairs are matched
You can reset the game by hitting the restart button

Accomplish:

I want to create a simple yet fun game for people of all ages to enjoy. I also want this to evolve into a game where you can choose your own theme to be displayed on the cards. It can be a game to play even if you only have a few minutes to play or if you have all the time in the Galaxy!

Challenges:

I expect challenges when calling APi's
I expect challenges when tryign to code the various characters for the cards
There will definitely be challenges when trying to code various visual elements to make the game look like it was coded by someone other than a Software Enginnering student
